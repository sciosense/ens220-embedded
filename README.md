# ScioSense ENS220 C Library
C library for the ENS220 high-accuracy barometric pressure and temperature sensor.

The ENS220 is an ultra-low-power, high-accuracy barometric pressure and temperature sensor produced by
[ScioSense](http://www.sciosense.com). It comes in the smallest size LGA package with digital I2C and SPI interfaces. 
This enables new use cases in activity tracking, indoor navigation/localization, fall- and liquid-level detection.
